**Postmortem: Web Application Outage - Database Connection Issue**

---

Issue Summary:
**Duration:** The outage lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes, starting at 10:15 AM and ending at 12:00 PM (UTC) on August 19, 2024.

**Impact:** The web application was completely inaccessible to 85% of users, with the remaining 15% experiencing significant slowdowns. Users were unable to access core services, including login, data retrieval, and transaction processing.

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured database connection pool that exhausted available connections due to an unexpected surge in traffic, leading to the database server becoming unresponsive.

Timeline:

- **10:15 AM:** Issue detected by automated monitoring systems, which triggered an alert for high response times and timeouts on the web application.
- **10:20 AM:** The on-call engineer received the alert and began investigating the issue by checking the application server logs.
- **10:25 AM:** Initial investigation pointed to a possible issue with the web server; the server was restarted, but the problem persisted.
- **10:35 AM:** Further investigation into network issues was conducted, but no anomalies were found.
- **10:50 AM:** The database team was notified as application logs showed errors related to database connectivity.
- **11:00 AM:** Database logs indicated that all available connections in the pool were being utilized, causing the database to stop accepting new connections.
- **11:15 AM:** Database connection pool settings were identified as the root cause; an immediate adjustment was made to increase the maximum number of connections.
- **11:30 AM:** The application started recovering as the new connection pool settings took effect.
- **12:00 PM:** Full service was restored, and all users were able to access the application without issues.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a configuration issue in the database connection pool. The maximum number of database connections was set too low to handle the traffic surge, leading to a bottleneck. As traffic increased, all available connections were quickly consumed, preventing new database queries from being processed. This caused the application to hang, leading to widespread service unavailability.

**Resolution:** The issue was resolved by increasing the maximum number of connections in the database connection pool configuration. This adjustment allowed the database to handle the higher volume of concurrent requests. Additionally, the connection timeout settings were reduced to ensure that unused connections were released more quickly, preventing similar issues in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- **Review Database Configuration:** Conduct a thorough review of all database-related configurations to ensure they can handle peak traffic loads.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring of database connection usage and set up alerts for when connection pools are nearing their limits.
- **Traffic Load Testing:** Perform regular load testing to simulate high-traffic scenarios and adjust configurations accordingly.
- **Automated Scaling:** Explore options for implementing automated scaling of database resources based on real-time traffic patterns.

**TODO List:**
1. **Increase Database Connection Pool:** Permanently increase the maximum number of connections in the connection pool settings.
2. **Implement Connection Pool Monitoring:** Add detailed monitoring for connection pool usage and set up alerts for when connections exceed 80% utilization.
3. **Perform Load Testing:** Schedule regular load tests to simulate peak traffic and adjust database settings based on test results.
4. **Review and Optimize Queries:** Analyze and optimize any slow-running database queries to reduce the overall load on the database.
5. **Explore Auto-Scaling:** Investigate and implement auto-scaling for database resources to handle unexpected traffic surges without manual intervention.
